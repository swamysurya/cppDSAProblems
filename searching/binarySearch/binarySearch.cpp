/*
1. what is overflow in binary search ?
ans: If low and high are both large values, their sum (low + high)
may exceed the maximum limit of the integer type, causing an integer overflow.
In 32-bit signed integers (maximum value = 2^31 - 1),

int low = 2,000,000,000; 
int high = 2,100,000,000;
int mid = (low + high) / 2; // Potential overflow

Here, low + high = 4,100,000,000, which exceeds the maximum signed 32-bit integer limit (2,147,483,647), causing overflow and resulting in an incorrect mid value.

Instead of (low + high) / 2, use:

int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
Since high - low is always positive and smaller than high + low, adding low after dividing by 2 keeps the result within the valid range.

This is a safer and recommended approach in all programming languages that deal with fixed-width integers.


â€‹2. how to calculate time complexcity ?
ans: 
1. each step reduces the search space by half
 n -> n/2 -> n/4 -> n/8 -> ... -> 1
2. after k steps the search space will be 1
        n/(2^k) - 1
3. solving k
    n = 2^k
    log n = k
    k = log n
